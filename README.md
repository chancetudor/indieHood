## Welcome to indieHood! 

indieHood is the best way to connect yourself to a local music scene.


### What is indieHood?

indieHood is an app with the simple goal of connecting avid music lovers to smaller indie bands. As of now, no platform exists that gives smaller artists and bands a way to advertise their performances. We are aiming to change that. With indieHood users can find local live shows that they would have otherwise never heard of. With indieHood artists can work to expand their fanbase and share their music with people who would have otherwise never heard it.

indieHood is about exploring a local music scene, connecting music lovers, and helping out those smaller artists.
